# FYS4411 - Computational Physics II: Quantum Mechanical Systems
This is the public repository for the master-subject FYS4411 at the University of Oslo.
This course is an advanced course on computational physics with an emphasis on quantum mechanical systems with many interacting particles. The applications and the computational methods are relevant for research problems in such diverse areas as nuclear, atomic, molecular and solid-state physics, chemistry and materials science.
The course consists of two main projects, where you will find more information resting within each folder.

# Project 1

## Variational Monte Carlo on Bosons


# Project 2
